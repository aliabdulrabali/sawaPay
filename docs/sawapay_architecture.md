# SawaPay MVP Architecture Plan

## System Overview

SawaPay is a modern digital payment application inspired by PayPal, designed to facilitate secure and convenient financial transactions. The MVP will consist of three main components:

1. **Web Application**: A responsive web interface for users to access all payment features
2. **Mobile Application**: Native mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms
3. **Admin Dashboard**: A comprehensive management interface for administrators

All components will be powered by Firebase as the backend infrastructure, providing authentication, database, storage, and serverless functions.

## Technology Stack

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Firebase Authentication**: For secure user authentication across all platforms
- **Cloud Firestore**: NoSQL database for storing user data, transactions, and application state
- **Firebase Storage**: For storing user documents, profile images, and KYC verification files
- **Firebase Functions**: Serverless functions for business logic, payment processing, and notifications
- **Firebase Hosting**: For hosting the web application and admin dashboard

### Web Frontend
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Redux**: For state management
- **React Router**: For navigation
- **Firebase SDK**: For direct integration with Firebase services

### Mobile Frontend
- **React Native** (recommended over Flutter for code sharing with web): For cross-platform mobile development
- **React Navigation**: For mobile app navigation
- **Redux**: For state management
- **Firebase SDK**: For direct integration with Firebase services
- **Native Modules**: For platform-specific features (camera, biometrics, push notifications)

### Admin Dashboard
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the admin interface
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling consistent with the main application
- **Redux**: For state management
- **React Router**: For navigation
- **Firebase Admin SDK**: For privileged access to Firebase services
- **Chart.js/D3.js**: For analytics and data visualization

## Component Architecture

Custom claims will be used to distinguish between regular users and administrators.

### Firestore Database Structure

The database will be organized into the following collections:

1. **users**:
   - User profile information
   - Account settings
   - Security preferences
   - KYC status

2. **wallets**:
   - Balance information
   - Transaction limits
   - Linked payment methods

3. **transactions**:
   - Transfer details
   - Transaction status
   - Timestamps
   - References to sender and recipient

4. **kyc_documents**:
   - Document references
   - Verification status
   - Admin notes
   - Timestamps

5. **notifications**:
   - Notification content
   - Read status
   - Timestamps
   - User references

6. **support_tickets**:
   - Ticket details
   - Status
   - Messages
   - User references

7. **content**:
   - Terms and conditions
   - FAQ items
   - About page content

### Firebase Storage Structure

Storage will be organized into the following directories:

1. **/profile_images/**:
   - User profile pictures

2. **/kyc_documents/**:
   - ID documents
   - Selfie verification
   - Proof of address

3. **/support_attachments/**:
   - Files attached to support tickets

### Firebase Functions

Cloud Functions will handle the following operations:

1. **Authentication Triggers**:
   - User creation
   - Profile updates
   - Security changes

2. **Transaction Processing**:
